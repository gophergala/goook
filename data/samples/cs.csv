160	Normativity logic Incompleteness absence alternative natural numbers  ascribed ready-made normativity inducing rigid departure syntax/semantics Geometry Interaction, set in the noncommutative universe of von Neumann algebras, makes normative assumptions explicit, thus rending possible their internalisation, a possible way out from the semantic aporia. As an illustration, we define an alternative “model”: logspace integers.
